The scope of the project is to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting and localizing brain tumors based on MRI Scan Images.The layered Deep Learning Pipeline to perform classification and image segmentation.
I have used Resnet Deep Learning Classifier Model on MRI Scan Images to predict the Tumor presence and to classify accordingly. If Tumor detected, I have further used Resunet Image Segmentation Model to locate the tumor using pixels.
